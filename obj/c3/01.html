             *Perhaps one could argue that a function becomes a method, not at definition time, 
            but during run-time just for that invocation,  depending on how it's called at its call-site 
            See this\c2\03-implicitBinding.html 
            Even this interpretation is a bit of a stretch.
            The safest conclusion is probably that "function" and "method" are interchangeable in JavaScript.
