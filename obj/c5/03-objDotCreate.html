             *Bar.prototype = Foo.prototype doesn't create a new object for Bar.prototype to be linked to.
             *It just makes Bar.prototype be another reference to Foo.prototype, which effectively links Bar directly
             *to the same object as Foo links to: Foo.prototype.
             *This means when you start assigning, like Bar.prototype.myLabel = ...,
             *you're modifying not a separate object but the shared Foo.prototype object itself,
             *which would affect any objects linked to Foo.prototype.
             *This is almost certainly not what you want.
             *If it is what you want, then you likely don't need Bar at all,
             *and should just use only Foo and make your code simpler.
