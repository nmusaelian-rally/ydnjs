             We could have written this as an object literal ({}),
             but by enclosing it in a function instead we created a closure.
             This has the effect of protecting state (and potentially functionality)
             from the outside world.
             We return only the public API,everything else is private â€“
             the names of voters cannot be listed,
             the vote tallies can only be updated by voting.
