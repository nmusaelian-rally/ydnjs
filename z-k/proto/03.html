            //which effectively links Surrogate to the same object that Animal is linked to,
            //which is Animal.prototype,
            //which means that if you add a property on Surrogate.prototype, e.g
            //Surrogate.prototype.fly you are not modifying a separate obj,
            //but a shared obj Foo.prototype
            //here is the test:

            //generally this is not what we want
            //we could do Dog.prototype = new Animal() which would create a new object linked to Animal.prototype
            //but since we do not want to create a new instance of Animal for that, we use Surrogate instead:
            Dog.prototype = new Surrogate();
            Dog.prototype.bark = function(){
                console.log('bark');

            var someDog = new Dog();
            someDog.bark(); //bark
            someDog.fly(); //I can fly
            
            //the silly choice of 'fly' property added to Animal.prototype via Surrogare.prototype
            //is to underscore why we don't want to say:
            //Dog.prototype = Animal.prototype
            //it makes sense to add properties to the Dog that Animal does not have.
            //but there is never a need to add properties to a Surrogate, so the 'fly' was to
            //illustrate why Dog.prototype = Animal.prototype should be avoided.
            //Adding properties to Surrogate technically does not prevent us from adding properties to Animal
            //but in real life adding properties to Surrogate makes no sense, so there is no danger
            //of someone intentionally adding a property on a Surrogate and inadvertently modifying Aimal.
            //The role of the surrogate is to block the link between Dog.protype and Animal.prototype.
            //Now if we add a property to Dog.prototype it is not going to add property to Animal.prototype
            //This  results in error, which is good,
            //we don't want any animal to bark:
            
            //someAnimal.bark(); //Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function 
            
            //so far this is better than 02.html because we solbes of the two problems:
            //we wanted to avoid creating a new Animal instance when setting Dog's prototype.
            //the other problem remains: that the "super class" Animal constructor is not called
            //when "sub class" Dog is created.
