<!--
realative means relative to itself. E.g. 

position:relative;
top:10px;

will cause an element to move 10px down from where it would normally appear.
Also, the space it would take then would still be taken.
Relative does NOT mean relative to the parent containter.

If you don't specify top, bottom, left, right properties, positoin:relative will do nothing.
