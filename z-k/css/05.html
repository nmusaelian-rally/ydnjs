<!--
if a parent element contains only floated elements (children), it has zero height.
To fix, add :after pseudo-selector to insert an empty string inside <section> with
'clear' property that tells which side(s) of an element other floating elements are not allowed.
In this case, both.
The clear property applies to both floating and non-floating elements.
It specifies whether an element can be next to floating elements that precede it, or must be moved down (cleard) below them.
