             *Whenever you see the function keyword within another function,
             *the inner function has access to variables in the outer function.
             *That is a closure.
             *
             *A function doesn't have to return in order to be called a closure.
             *Simply accessing variables outside of your immediate lexical scope creates a closure.
             *
             *In 06.html function did not return. Inner bar was called from inside outer foo.
             *
             *In this 07.html the code is slightly changed, but it does the same thing.
             *Instead of named function bar that is called explicilty from inside foo,
             *foo now returns anonymous function
             *
             *Here bar() can still refer to x and tmp, even though it is no longer directly inside the scope.
             *(the outer foo has exited)
             *
             *Also, since tmp is still hanging around inside bar's closure,
             *it is being incremented. It will be incremented each time you call bar.
