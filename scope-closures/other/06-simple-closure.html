            wallaceSpeak(); //GROMIT!!!
            
            // inner functions have access to any of the containing functions local variables.
            /* To understand what closure is you first need to understand stack-frames.
            A stack frame is a thing that you push on the stack. They are data structures that contain information about functions to call.
            In the case of a call stack, a stack frame represents a function call and its argument data.
            Each stack frame corresponds to a call to a function.
            
            In js functions still create stack-frames however, inner functions have access to any of the containing functions local variables.
            So a closure is a stack-frame that doesn’t go away after the outer function is complete.
            In the above Javascript sream() is an inner function of yell().
            When wallaceSpeak() is called, it still had access to allCaps var of its containing function.
            A closure in js is created each time you put a function inside another function.
