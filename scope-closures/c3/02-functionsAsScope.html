            //1. Identifier name foo itself "pollutes" the enclosing scope (global, in this case)
            //2. We also have to explicitly call the function by name (foo()) so that the wrapped code actually executes.
            
            //here is solution for both:
            
            var b =2;

            console.log('outside foo', b); //2

             * In the first snippet, the name foo is bound in the enclosing scope, and we call it directly with foo().
             * In the second snippet, the name bar is not bound in the enclosing scope, but instead is bound only inside of its own function.
             * (function bar(){ .. }) as an expression means the identifier bar is not found in the outer scope.
             *  Hiding the name bar inside itself means it does not pollute the enclosing scope unnecessarily.
