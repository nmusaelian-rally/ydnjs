             requirements for the module:

            1. There must be an outer enclosing function, and it must be invoked at least once
            (each time creates a new module instance).

            2. The enclosing function must return back at least one inner function,
            so that inner function has closure over the private scope, and can access and/or modify that private state.
             
            When we transport foo and bar outside of the lexical scope, by way of property references on the object
             we return, closure can be observed and exercised.
