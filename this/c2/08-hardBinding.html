             It’s nice to have a way to specify binding, as was done in 07-explicit binding,
             but the problem is, you can only specify it at invocation time.
             You can’t, say, specify it in advance and then let some other code invoke your properly bound method when it sees fit.
             This is a major problem, because when we pass method references around, we’re doing just that: letting other code choose when to invoke methods.
             So what we want is a way to persistently bind a method, so that we get a bound method reference.
             The only way to achieve this requires us to wrap our original method in another one, that will perform the apply call.
