            /*
            When you do all your JavaScript heavy lifting by hand, as we just did, you’re usually more aware of such issues.
            But when you rely on a framework to handle the basics, binding can elude you, leaving you writing simple code that just borks.
            Consider the following snippet:
            
            this.items.each(function(item) {
                this.markItemAsProcessed(item);
            });
            
            This code will trigger an error stating that the markItemAsProcessed method is undefined.  You just passed each a reference to an anonymous function,
            so 'this' in there refers to 'window', not to what it was outside each.
