<!--
by the time we pass 3 and 9 to add(), js engine has two stacks,
with 2 and 10, and 3 and 9
JS engine to remember 2 and 10 because by the time it is done with the second execution of add()
it potenitally may end up in the first execution context
When the final call to add() ocurrs and we discover that y is 0 we return the accumulated
value of x. 
That returned value has to be passed back through each execution context effectively closing each stak
until we reach the very first execution context that was created when we ran add(2,10)
